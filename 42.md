External Embed Sizing
---------------

`draft` `optional` `author:deanpress`

An `embed-sizes` array in notes that allows relays to store information about the filesizes of external embeddable media (i.e. URLs to images and other media in posts and avatars).

Clients can auto-embed small media within a configured limit, and not auto-embed larger media by default (and give the user an option to click "View Embedded Media"), to save user bandwidth and prevent abuse.

Spec
---------------
```
tag: embed-sizes
values:
 - [array of strings of filesizes in bytes, in order of urls in note content]: required
```

Example
---------------
```json
{
    "pubkey": "<pub-key>",
    "created_at": 1000000000,
    "kind": 1,
    "tags": [
      ["embed-sizes", ["500000", "1500000", "0"]]
    ],
    "content": "https://imgur.com/1.png and https://imgur.com/2.png and https://imgu2.com/3.png.",
    "id": "<event-id>"
}
```
In this example the `1.png` embed is 500kb, `2.png` is 1.5MB, and `3.png` was not estimated (due to no `Content-Length` header, or the header doesn't match the real content's size).

Client Behavior
---------------
Clients SHOULD check the `embed-sizes` array for each externally linked embeddable media url in a note and only auto-embed the media if it's within the client's (or user's) configured max allowed auto-embeddable filesize. If the `embed-sizes` value of the media embed is `"0"`, also don't auto-embed the media.

Relay Behavior
---------------
* Relays SHOULD check external URL embeds for a `Content-Length` header. If `Content-Length` exists and is within the Relay's configured max filesize limit for embeddable content, verify the size is correct by attempting to download the file to a temporary cache (up to the `Content-Length`) and storing the filesize (in bytes) in the note's `embed-sizes` array if it matches. If the `Content-Length` header does not exist, or the file is not fully downloaded after reaching the `Content-Length` limit, set the value belonging to the URL's array key in `embed-sizes` to `"0"`.
* Relays SHOULD delete cached media after the above filesize validation process was completed.
